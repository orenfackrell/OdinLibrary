# OdinLibrary

The task is to create a library app which allows the user to fill a form to create objects for each book, which is then added to a library array. The contents of this array will be displayed on the page and the user can interact with the books in this library with their own 'cards' - with functionality to toggle if the book has been read and the ability to remove it from the library.
This project will be utilizing: Arrays for storage; objects; object creation; forms in HTML; form submition; form validation and JS to have an interactable library interface on the page.
